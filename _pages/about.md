Hello! I’m Nanddeep Nachan, the writer of this blog.

I am from Pune, Maharashtra, India and is a newborn Microsoft MVP (Office Apps & Services). I am happily married and living with my loving family (Parents, caring sister, lovely wife, and a sweet newborn junior).

I born in a small town [Khopoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khopoli), cocooned amidst the Sahyadri mountains. Spent my childhood at [Matheran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matheran), a cozy little hill station. Eventually moved to Mumbai for higher educations and landed in Pune for the job.

I like reading historical books and a big fan of Sherlock Holmes. Photography is my recent developed hobby and I have perceived a Diploma in Photography from Shaw Academy (UK).

On a technical note, I’m a results oriented Technology Architect with experience in Microsoft Technologies especially with SharePoint, MS Azure and .NET. Experienced in design, implementation, configuration, and maintenance of several large-scale projects.

Organizer and frequent speaker at various industry seminars, conferences, and community events including SPS, Global Microsoft 365 Developer Bootcamp, and Global Power Platform Bootcamp.
