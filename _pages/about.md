Hello! I’m Nanddeep Nachan.

I am from Pune, Maharashtra, India. Microsoft MVP (M365 Apps & Services), Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT). I find joy in being happily wed and residing with my affectionate family, which includes my parents, a caring sister, a lovely wife, and a son.

I came into this world in the quaint town of [Khopoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khopoli), nestled amidst the Sahyadri mountains. Spent my childhood at [Matheran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matheran), a cozy little hill station. As time went on, I made my way to Mumbai for higher education and eventually settled in Pune for work.

I like reading historical books and a big fan of Sherlock Holmes. Photography is my recent developed hobby and I have perceived a Diploma in Photography from Shaw Academy (UK). During my childhood, I used to play the Tabla, a musical instrument.

On a technical note, I’m a results oriented Technology Architect with experience in Microsoft Technologies especially with SharePoint, MS Azure and .NET. Experienced in design, implementation, configuration, and maintenance of several large-scale projects. Adept in end-to-end development of the system starting from the Pre-Sales activities, Cost Estimating models, RFC’s to the closure of the projects using DevOps, Agile, and Waterfall Model methodologies. Experience in providing management expertise over a wide range of technical environments and industries, specialized in critical customer projects and complex technology deployments.

I am an Active contributor to [Microsoft 365 & Power Platform Community, PnP](https://aka.ms/m365pnp), offering my contributions in the form of sample scripts, SPFx solutions, MS Teams solutions, Power Platform Connectors, and more.
