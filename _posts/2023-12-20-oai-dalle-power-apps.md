## Introduction

Dall-E is a neural network that can generate images from text descriptions. It is named after the artist Salvador Dali and the Pixar character WALL-E. Dall-E can create realistic and surrealistic images of anything one can imagine, such as a snail made of a harp, a radish wearing a tutu, or a painting of a capybara in a field of tulips.

This article will explain how Dall-E works, how to use it with Azure OpenAI, the benefits of using it, and how you can use it in Power Apps.


## How Dall-E works

Dall-E uses a large-scale language model called GPT-3, which can generate natural language texts from any input. GPT-3 is trained on a huge corpus of text from the internet, and it can learn to generate coherent and diverse texts on any topic. Dall-E extends GPT-3 by adding a vision component, which can generate images from text inputs. Dall-E uses a technique called text-to-image synthesis, which converts natural language descriptions into pixel values. Dall-E can also generate images from incomplete or ambiguous texts, such as "an armchair in the shape of an avocado" or "a cat wearing a suit".


## The benefits of using Dall-E with Azure OpenAI

Using Dall-E with Azure OpenAI has many benefits, such as:

- One can access the most advanced image generation model without any coding or infrastructure.
- One can create unique and original images for one's projects, such as logos, illustrations, posters, or memes.
- One can explore one's creativity and imagination by generating images from any text input.
- One can learn more about the capabilities and limitations of artificial intelligence and its impact on society.


## How to use Dall-E with Azure OpenAI

Azure OpenAI is a cloud service that provides access to the most advanced artificial intelligence models, such as GPT-3 and Dall-E. Azure OpenAI allows one to create and deploy applications that use these models without any coding or infrastructure. One can use Azure OpenAI to experiment with Dall-E and generate images from one's text inputs. The following are the steps to use Dall-E with Azure OpenAI:

1. Create an Azure account and sign up for Azure OpenAI.
2. Go to the Azure OpenAI portal and select Dall-E from the list of models.
3. Enter one's text input in the query box and click on generate.
4. Wait for a few seconds and see the images generated by Dall-E.
5. One can also modify the text input or select different images from the grid.

The **View code** option provides the endpoint and key information on how to consume the Dall-E API.

On the **Network** tab of the browser, you should see a response with the id of the image generated.

You should see another GET request with the above generated id.

The response shows the URL to the image generated.

## Postman Collection

We will now create a Postman collection of the above two requests.

The Postman collection is attached [here](/media/2023-12-20-oai-dalle-power-apps/Dall-E.postman_collection.json) for reference.


## Custom Connector in Power Platform

With the Postman collection, we can proceed to create a custom connector in Power Platform.

## Power Apps for Dall-E image generation

In the Power Apps app, add the custom connector (for e.g., named Dall-E) to get started. The canvas looks as follows with the basic elements in place.

The below table shows the events and code on each element.

| **Element** | **Event** | **Code** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ButtonDownload | OnSelect | Download(ImageDallE.Image) |
| ImageDallE | Image | Text(First(varFinalResponse.result.data).url) |
| Timer | OnSelect | Set(varResponse, 'Dall-E'.Prompt("2023-06-01-preview", {prompt: TextInput.Text, n:1, size:"1024x1024"})); |
| | Duration | 10000 |

The app looks as follows:

## Summary

Dall-E is a neural network that can generate images from text descriptions. It uses a large-scale language model called GPT-3, which can generate natural language texts from any input. Using Postman collection and custom connector in Power Platform, Dall-E can be consumed in Power Apps for image generation.
