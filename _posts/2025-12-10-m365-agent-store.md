## Introduction

At Microsoft Ignite 2025, Microsoft announced one of the most important updates in the Copilot and agentic-AI ecosystem - the **Microsoft 365 Agent Store**. This new marketplace brings AI agents directly into the Microsoft 365 environment, helping organizations discover, deploy, and govern ready-made or custom-built agents securely and at scale.

The Agent Store marks a major shift from "AI features" to **AI-powered workflows**, allowing businesses to use specialized agents for tasks like document summarization, ticket triage, HR automation, compliance monitoring, SharePoint insights, and more. Instead of building everything from scratch, customers can now select from curated, safe, compliant agents that are instantly usable inside the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

## What is the Agent Store?

The **Microsoft 365 Agent Store** is a centralized marketplace, similar to the app store, where organizations can:

- Discover **prebuilt AI agents** created by Microsoft, partners, or internal developers
- Browse agents for productivity, IT operations, HR, finance, security, and industry-specific tasks
- Deploy agents to users or groups with controlled permissions
- Manage updates, compliance, and lifecycle from a central admin experience

Each agent in the store is built on the **Microsoft 365 Agent Framework**, ensuring it is:

- Secure
- Governed
- Integrated with Microsoft Graph
- Compatible with Copilot experiences
- Enterprise compliant (access controls, data boundaries, audit logs)

## Key Concepts Behind the Agent Store

**1\. Enterprise-ready agents**

Agents are designed to run inside the Microsoft 365 trust boundary. They can access:

- Files
- Teams chats
- SharePoint data
- Outlook mail
- Calendar
- Planner / Loop tasks

All access respects user permissions and organization policies.

**2\. Multi-channel availability**

Agents from the Store can work across:

- **M365 Chat**
- **Microsoft Copilot in Teams**
- **SharePoint**
- **Outlook**
- **Third-party apps**, depending on configuration
- **Copilot Studio** (for customization)

**3\. Publisher ecosystem**

The store includes agents from:

- **Microsoft** (e.g., SharePoint Agent, Security Agent)
- **Independent Software Vendors (ISVs)**
- **Enterprise developers**, who can publish internal agents to the private catalog

**4\. Compliance & governance**

Admins have full control:

- Approve or block agents
- Assign usage permissions
- Track analytics, usage, and data access
- Enforce DLP, sensitivity labels, retention policies
