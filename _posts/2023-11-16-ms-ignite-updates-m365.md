## Introduction

Microsoft Ignite 2023 is happening in Seattle on 14-17 November 2023, and digitally on November 15-16, 2023. It is an opportunity to explore the best of what is next in technology.

In this article, I have summarized the upcoming features and announcements in the Microsoft 365 Apps & Services areas.


## Introducing SharePoint Premium

Microsoft has introduced SharePoint Premium, an AI-driven solution to enhance content management and experiences. It prepares content for Microsoft Copilot, a set of AI tools, by providing a solid foundation of structure, security, and governance for organizational content. Currently, in preview, SharePoint Premium is set to be widely available early next year.

SharePoint Premium introduces new features such as content experiences for seamless collaboration, AI-driven content solutions for business processes, and enhanced content management services. It includes capabilities from Microsoft Syntex and SharePoint Advanced Management, expanding content management in Microsoft 365. The rollout of SharePoint Premium services will occur gradually, with full availability expected by the first half of 2024.

## Availability of Microsoft Clipchamp and app integrations for Microsoft Designer

Microsoft 365 is making visual content creation easy for businesses with tools like Microsoft Clipchamp and Microsoft Designer. Clipchamp, available for Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Business users, democratizes video and image creation. Clipchamp Premium, featuring 4K exports and premium content, will be available in December 2023. Microsoft Designer, integrated into various Microsoft 365 apps, allows users to create images seamlessly within their workflow. It's accessible for Enterprise and Business users, with additional features rolling out in the coming weeks and months. The Designer app will have a preview soon, followed by general availability next year.

## General availability of Microsoft Loop

Microsoft Loop is now available for web and mobile (iOS and Android) for commercial customers, while the mobile app is also available for consumer customers. Full functionality is accessible to business customers with specific Microsoft 365 licenses. Recent improvements include Workspace status for upcoming deadlines, intelligent workspace descriptions, and Power Automate integration for task tracking. Additionally, users can start a Loop workspace directly from Teams after a meeting, automatically populating it with related documents and notes. These features are either in preview or set to be released by the end of 2023.

## New updates for frontline workers

The Microsoft Loop app is now available for web and mobile (iOS and Android) for commercial customers, with additional availability for consumer users. New updates focus on enhancing the experience for frontline workers in Microsoft 365. The Copilot tool, offering AI-powered searches and content generation, will be accessible to Entra ID users with F3 licenses, providing commercial data protection. The Shifts plugin for Copilot streamlines tasks for frontline managers, while dynamic membership capabilities in the Teams admin center aid in deploying and managing frontline teams more efficiently. A deployment tool for Shifts at scale and a domain-less sign-in feature for faster Teams access are also in the pipeline, with various features set to be available in December or early 2024.

## Microsoft Planner unified experience

Microsoft is streamlining task and project management by combining Microsoft To Do, Microsoft Planner, and Microsoft Project for the web into a unified experience called Microsoft Planner. This integrated platform, set to launch in the Planner app within Microsoft Teams in spring 2024, and on the web later in the year, is designed to be powerful, collaborative, and scalable. With next-generation AI assistance, it aims to help users efficiently manage their work and achieve goals.

The new Planner experience caters to a wide range of users, from information workers to frontline workers to project managers. It offers easy task discovery, allowing users to focus on today's priorities. Planner provides flexibility, enabling users to work in a way that suits individual tasks or team initiatives. It also supports robust project management, allowing users to create plans with advanced scheduling and resourcing tools that adapt to evolving business needs.

The introduction of Copilot in Planner accelerates plan creation by offering simple prompts, evolving plans with goals, and intelligently suggesting tasks to track progress. The Tasks by Planner and To-Do app in Microsoft Teams will be renamed Planner, and Microsoft Project for the web will also undergo a renaming process, with both continuing to offer familiar features under the new name.

The new Planner app, featuring premium work management capabilities and AI-powered experiences, will be available in Microsoft Teams in spring 2024, with the web experience following later.
