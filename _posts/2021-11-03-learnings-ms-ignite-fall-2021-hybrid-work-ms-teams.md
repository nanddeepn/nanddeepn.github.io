## Overview
Microsoft Ignite Fall 2021 is happening on November 2 - 4, 2021. It is exciting as always with new features and announcements all across Microsoft products.

In this article, we will focus on what's new for Microsoft Teams on hybrid work.

## Hybrid Working Theme
The past 20 months living in pandemic situation have changed our life. The work is completely redefined. Nearly every human interaction now involves a digital touch point.

Jared Spataro (Microsoft) started his session [Empower everyone for a new world of hybrid work](https://myignite.microsoft.com/sessions/4c7e0a4c-96ad-4f27-aa61-087ee16a7683) with an exciting statement - `Hybrid work is here to stay`.

`Hybrid working` is one of the theme of Microsoft Ignite Fall 2021 to answer the biggest question of how we prepare for it? Microsoft cloud empowers everyone in this new era and Microsoft Teams is at the center of it all.

## Windows 11
Windows 11 is the best OS for the hybrid work. It is most productive, collaborative and secure windows ever. Easy to deploy.

## MS Office
Word, Excel, PowerPoint – they are not going anywhere. In fact they are getting better with Teams integration.

## Microsoft Loop
Microsoft loop is the next big breakthrough in Microsoft 365. Loop is an app for communication first and AI first world. With loop we can collaborate with our innovation from chat, email, meeting, or a document.

[Microsoft Loop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-loop) is a whole new way to work together. It has 3 core elements:
1. Loop Workspaces: These are shared spaces that allow you and your team to see and group and track everything important to your project.
2. Loop Pages: These are flexible canvases to organize your components and pull in helpful elements like links, files, or data to suit your specific project needs.
3. Loop Components: Allow you to collaborate in the flow of work. Loop components can be lists, tables, notes, or a customer sales opportunity from Dynamics 365.

## Context IQ
Context IQs are context aware which turns insights in to actions so that we will no more switching apps, manually copying and pasting links in email.

Context IQ Editor brings in AI capabilities while you work with below scenarios:
1. Editor suggests relevant documents based on similar subjects while you attach, insert, or share files with colleagues.
