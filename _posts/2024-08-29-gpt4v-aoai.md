## Overview

GPT-4 Turbo with Vision is a powerful model by OpenAI that can look at images and answer questions about them using text. It combines language understanding and visual processing.

In this article, we will explore GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model capabilities, use cases, and adding your own data.

## OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo with Vision

GPT-4 Turbo with Vision is a multi-modal model large language model (LLM) designed to process both text and image inputs to generate text outputs. This powerful model leverages the capabilities of OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 architecture, integrating advanced vision features to enhance data analysis, customer interactions, and automation processes. It aims to streamline operations across various industries, from retail to healthcare, by enabling applications to understand and interpret visual data alongside text.

**Key Features in Azure AI Studio**

1. **Image Analysis**:
    - **Object Detection**: Automatically detects and labels objects within images, enabling applications to recognize and categorize visual elements.
    - **Image Tagging and Categorization**: Assigns tags to images based on their content and categorizes them accordingly.
    - **Scene and Activity Recognition**: Identifies the context and activities occurring within an image.
2. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**:
    - **Text Extraction**: Extracts printed or handwritten text from images and documents, converting them into machine-readable text.
    - **Form Recognition**: Identifies and processes text in structured forms, enhancing document digitization processes.
3. **Face Recognition**:
    - **Face Detection**: Detects human faces within images and provides information about their attributes, such as age, gender, and emotions.
    - **Face Identification**: Matches detected faces against a database of known individuals.
4. **Spatial Analysis**:
    - **People Counting and Tracking**: Analyzes video feeds to count and track the movement of people in a defined space, useful for security and business analytics.
5. **Landmark and Celebrity Recognition**:
    - **Landmark Identification**: Recognizes famous landmarks and provides information about them.
    - **Celebrity Recognition**: Identifies well-known public figures within images.

## Deployment

Deploying the GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model on Azure is a straightforward process. The general availability of this model is currently limited to the limited regions.

To deploy the model:

1. Create an Azure OpenAI resource in the West US region.
2. Choose the "GPT-4" model and select the "vision-preview" version from the dropdown menu to deploy the model.
