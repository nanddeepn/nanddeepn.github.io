## Overview
The Shared Channels feature in MS Teams is still in preview and is rolling to the M365 tenants. It provides a flexible way to collaborate with people from different teams and organizations which makes it easy to work without tenant switching for vendors, partners, and customers.

In this article, we will cover how to work with the shared channels.

## Enable Shared Channels
Once the Shared Channel feature is available in your tenant, it will be turned on by default. MS Teams administrator can configure the Shared channel settings as follows:

1. Open [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/).
2. From the left menu, click **Teams** > **Teams policies**.

3. Configure your desired settings.
    1. **Create shared channels**: Team owners can create shared channels for people within and outside the organization. Only people added to the shared channel can read and write messages.
    2. **Invite external users to shared channels**: Owners of a shared channel can invite external users to join the channel, if Azure AD external sharing policies are configured.
    3. **Join external shared channels**: Users and teams can be invited to external shared channels, if Azure AD external sharing policies are configured.

## Enable developer preview

At the moment, you will have to enable the developer preview in MS Teams to use the Shared Channel experience.

Follow the below steps to enable the developer preview:

1. Open **MS Teams**.
2. Click **â€¦** > **About** > **Developer preview**.
