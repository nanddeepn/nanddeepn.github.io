## Overview

Managing permissions in SharePoint Online is a sensitive task. While granting or restricting access is straightforward, mistakes can happen - especially when a library is set to unique permissions and an administrator unintentionally removes all groups and users.

This creates a lockout situation where no one can access the library, including site members and owners. Fortunately, SharePoint provides multiple ways to regain access and restore permissions.

## Understanding SharePoint Permission Model

Before we jump into recovery steps, let's clarify how SharePoint handles permissions:

1. **Inheritance by Default**
    - Every site, list, or library inherits permissions from its parent.
    - Example: A document library inherits permissions from the site.

2. **Breaking Inheritance**
    - Administrators can choose to break inheritance and set unique permissions for a library.
    - This is often done to give only specific people access to sensitive libraries.

3. **Risks of Unique Permissions**
    If all users/groups are removed from a library that has unique permissions:
    - No one except Site Collection Administrators can access it.
    - Users see errors like “Access Denied” or the library simply disappears from navigation.


## Scenario: All Permissions Removed from a Library

Imagine you created a **Finance Documents** library and set unique permissions to restrict it. While cleaning up groups, you mistakenly **removed everyone** (including Owners, Members, and Visitors). Now, no one can open the library.

**What's happening here?**

- The library no longer inherits from the site.
- There are **zero permissions** assigned.
- Without intervention, the library becomes orphaned.


## Step-by-Step Recovery Process

### Step 1: Check Site Collection Admin Access

- Go to the site in question.
- Append `/_layouts/15/settings.aspx` to the URL. For e.g.,

    ```
    https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/Finance/_layouts/15/settings.aspx
    ```

- From **Site Settings → Site Permissions**, confirm if you are a **Site Collection Administrator**.  
- If yes → proceed to Step 2.  
- If not → contact a SharePoint or Global Admin to add you as one.

### **Step 2: Restore Permissions from Library Settings**

Once you have admin rights:

1. Navigate to the document library. (If it's hidden from quick launch, you may need to use the full URL:  
 `https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/Finance/Finance Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx`)

2. Go to: **Settings (⚙️) → Library Settings → Permissions for this document library**

3. Choose one of the following recovery options:
 - **Reset to Inherit Permissions**  
   Click **Delete unique permissions** → This resets the library back to site-level permissions.  
 - **Manually Add Groups**  
   Use **Grant Permissions** to add groups such as:  
   - *Site Owners* → Full Control  
   - *Site Members* → Edit or Contribute  
   - *Site Visitors* → Read

---

### **Step 3: If the Library Is Completely Inaccessible**
Sometimes the library URL itself throws *“Access Denied”*. In that case:

1. Open **SharePoint Admin Center**.
2. Select **Sites → Active Sites** → choose the affected site.
3. Click **Permissions → Site Collection Administrators**.
4. Add yourself or another admin back.  

Once you are Site Admin, revisit the library and restore permissions as in Step 2.

### **Step 4: PowerShell Recovery (Advanced Method)**

For large environments or automation, PowerShell provides a quick way to reset or reapply permissions.

#### **Option A: Reset to Inherit Permissions**

```powershell
# Connect to the site
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/Finance" -Interactive

# Reset library permissions to inherit from the site
Set-PnPList -Identity "Finance Documents" -ResetRoleInheritance
```

#### **Option B: Grant a User Full Control**

```powershell
# Break inheritance but start fresh
Set-PnPList -Identity "Finance Documents" -BreakRoleInheritance:$true -CopyRoleAssignments:$false -ClearSubscopes:$true

# Grant yourself Full Control
Add-PnPListRoleAssignment -List "Finance Documents" -Principal "admin@tenant.com" -RoleDefinition "Full Control"
```

This ensures at least one administrator regains access immediately.

## Common Pitfalls and Mistakes

1. **Relying on Individual Permissions**

    Avoid giving access directly to users. Always use SharePoint groups or Microsoft 365 groups.

2. **Removing Owners Group**

    This is the fastest way to lock yourself out. The Owners group should always remain.

3. **Not Documenting Permissions**

    When multiple libraries have unique permissions, it becomes difficult to track. Always keep a record.

4. **Breaking Inheritance Without Need**

    Only break inheritance when there is a real business requirement.


## Best Practices to Prevent Future Lockouts

- **Keep at Least One Owners Group Intact**

    Even in libraries with unique permissions, ensure that Site Owners or a dedicated admin group remains.

- **Use Security Groups, Not Individuals**

    Add Azure AD groups or M365 groups for easier management.

- **Establish a Permissions Policy**

    Document when and why unique permissions can be applied.
    Define roles like:
    - Owners = Full Control
    - Members = Edit
    - Visitors = Read

- **Audit Regularly**

    Use SharePoint Admin Center or PowerShell to run permission reports.

- **Train Administrators**

    Ensure that site admins know the risks of removing groups.


## Summary

Accidentally removing all permissions from a SharePoint document library is not the end of the world. The content remains safe — you simply need to regain access using one of the following methods:

- **Site Collection Admin rights** → reset permissions.
- **SharePoint Admin Center** → reassign admin access.
- **PnP PowerShell** → reset or reapply permissions in bulk.

By combining these recovery steps with governance best practices, you can ensure your SharePoint environment remains both secure and manageable.
