## Overview

In the article Develop First Client Side Web Part, we developed basic SharePoint client web part which can run independently without any interaction with SharePoint.

In this article, we will explore to consume the Microsoft Graph in SharePoint Framework client side web parts.


## Brief about Microsoft Graph

MS Graph is a rich and fast growing set of REST APIs provided by Microsoft to access content and services provided by Office 365. For example using Microsoft graph we can access mailbox, calendar, and one drive for business (OD4B) of a user. As well as we can access Site collection, sites, and lists in SharePoint Online. Also, we can access Office 365 Groups, Teams using MS Graph.

Read more about MS Graph at [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/overview](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/overview)


## Create SPFx Solution

1. Open command prompt. Create a directory for SPFx solution.

    ```
    md spfx-consume-msgraph
    ```

2. Navigate to above created directory.

    ```
    cd spfx-consume-msgraph
    ```

3. Run Yeoman SharePoint Generator to create the solution.

    ```
    yo @microsoft/sharepoint
    ```

4. Yeoman generator will present you with the wizard by asking questions about the solution to be created.

    ![](/media/2018-08-30-spfx-consume-ms-graph-api-using-msgraphclient/02.png)

    - **Solution Name:** Hit enter to have default name (spfx-consume-msgraph in this case) or type in any other name for your solution.
        - Selected choice: Hit enter
    - **Target for component:** Here we can select the target environment where we are planning to deploy the client webpart i.e. SharePoint Online or SharePoint OnPremise (SharePoint 2016 onwards).
        - Selected choice: SharePoint Online only (latest)
    - **Place of files:** We may choose to use the same folder or create a subfolder for our solution.
        - Selected choice: Same folder
    - **Deployment option:** Selecting Y will allow the app to deployed instantly to all sites and will be accessible everywhere.
        - Selected choice: N (install on each site explicitly)
    - **Type of client-side component to create:** We can choose to create client side webpart or an extension. Choose webpart option.
        - Selected choice: WebPart
    - **Web part name:** Hit enter to select the default name or type in any other name.
        - Selected choice: ConsumeMSGraph
    - **Web part description:** Hit enter to select the default description or type in any other value.
        - Selected choice: Consume MS Graph with SPFx
    - **Framework to use:** Select any JavaScript framework to develop the component. Available choices are (No JavaScript Framework, React, and Knockout)
        - Selected choice: React

5. Yeoman generator will perform scaffolding process to generate the solution. The scaffolding process will take significant amount of time.
6. Once the scaffolding process is completed, lock down the version of project dependencies by running below command.

    ```
    npm shrinkwrap
    ```

7. On the command prompt type below command to open the solution in code editor of your choice.

    ```
    code .
    ```


## Access MS Graph

Microsoft Graph can be accessed by either native graph client (MSGraphClient) or low-level type used to access Azure AD secured REST API (AadHttpClient)

In the ConsumeMsGraph.tsx file under "\src\webparts\consumeMsGraph\components\" folder, add below import statement.

```typescript
import { MSGraphClient } from '@microsoft/sp-client-preview';
```


## Typings for MS Graph

Microsoft Graph TypeScript Types enables intellisense on Microsoft Graph objects including users, messages, and groups.

On the command prompt, run below command to include typings.

```
npm install @microsoft/microsoft-graph-types --save-dev
```

This command will install types and save in package.json as a development dependency.

In the ConsumeMsGraph.tsx file under "\src\webparts\consumeMsGraph\components\" folder, add below import statement.

```typescript
import * as MicrosoftGraph from '@microsoft/microsoft-graph-types';
```


## Permissions

In order to consume MS Graph or any third party REST APIs, we need to explicitly specify the permissions in manifest of solution.

In the package-solution.json file under **config** folder, configure webApiPermissionRequests property to specify **User.ReadBasic.All** permission.

```json
{  
  "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/spfx-build/package-solution.schema.json",  
  "solution": {  
    "name": "spfx-consume-msgraph-client-side-solution",  
    "id": "f95e77e7-842b-4ac9-b3f7-f5c421efdb0d",  
    "version": "1.0.0.0",  
    "includeClientSideAssets": true,  
    "webApiPermissionRequests": [  
      {  
        "resource": "Microsoft Graph",  
        "scope": "User.ReadBasic.All"  
      }  
    ]  
  },  
  "paths": {  
    "zippedPackage": "solution/spfx-consume-msgraph.sppkg"  
  }  
}
```

webApiPermissionRequests is an array of webApiPermissionRequest items where each item is defined as below:

- resource: name or the ObjectId (in Azure AD). E.g. Microsoft Graph
- scope: name or unique ID of the permission

Please refer the permission API documentation at - [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_reference](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_reference)


## Configure Props

Define the context property in IConsumeMsGraphProps.ts under "\src\webparts\consumeMsGraph\components\".

```typescript
import { WebPartContext } from '@microsoft/sp-webpart-base';  
  
export interface IConsumeMsGraphProps {  
  description: string;  
  context: WebPartContext;  
}
```


## Configure State

We will define the state for our React component.

To define interface to represent user, add file IUserItem.ts under "\src\webparts\consumeMsGraph\components\".

```typescript
export interface IUserItem {  
    displayName: string;  
    mail: string;  
    userPrincipalName: string;  
}
```

Add file IConsumeMsGraphState.ts under "\src\webparts\consumeMsGraph\components\".

```typescript
import { IUserItem } from './IUserItem';  
  
export interface IConsumeMsGraphState {  
    users: Array<IUserItem>;  
}
```


## Get User Details

Implement below method to get the user details from your tenant.

```typescript
private getUserDetails(): void {  
  const graphClient: MSGraphClient = this.props.context.serviceScope.consume(  
    MSGraphClient.serviceKey  
  );  

  graphClient  
    .api("users")  
    .version("v1.0")  
    .select("displayName,mail,userPrincipalName")  
    .get((err, res) => {

      if (err) {  
        console.error(err);  
        return;  
      }  

      // Prepare the output array  
      var users: Array<IUserItem> = new Array<IUserItem>();  

      // Map the JSON response to the output array  
      res.value.map((item: any) => {  
        users.push( {   
          displayName: item.displayName,  
          mail: item.mail,  
          userPrincipalName: item.userPrincipalName,  
        });  
      });  

      // Update the component state accordingly to the result  
      this.setState(  
        {  
          users: users,  
        }  
      );  
    });  
}
```
