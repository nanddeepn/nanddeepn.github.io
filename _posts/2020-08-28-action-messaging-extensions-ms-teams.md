## Overview

Action-based messaging extensions allow users to trigger actions in external services while inside of Teams.

In this article, we will create action messaging extensions in a custom Microsoft Teams app using Yo Teams. The action message extension searches the planet information from JSON.


## Action messaging extension overview

A messaging extension is a cloud-hosted service that listens to user requests and responds with structured data, such as a card. It allows us to present users with a modal popup (called a task module in Teams) to collect or display information, then process their interaction and send information back to Teams. It takes advantage of the Bot Framework's messaging schema and secure communication protocol to connect with Microsoft Teams Client App.


## Prerequisites

Install below to get started:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - v10.* (or higher)
- NPM (installed with Node.js) - v6.* (or higher)
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - v4.* (or higher)
- [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) - v3.* (or higher)
- [Yeoman Generator for Microsoft Teams](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-teams) - v2.13.0 (or higher)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Install Yeoman, Gulp global command-line interface, and Typescript compiler globally using NPM.

```
npm install yo gulp-cli typescript --global
```

Install generator-teams globally using NPM.

```
npm install generator-teams --global
```

To install preview versions of the generator, run below command.

```
npm install generator-teams@preview --global
```


## Register Bot in Azure

Firstly, we need to register Bot in Azure to get the App Id and secret and configure the endpoint URL.

1. Open MS Azure Portal ([https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/))
2. Click **Create a resource**.
3. Search **Bot**.
4. Select **Bot Channels Registration**.

    ![](/media/2020-08-28-action-messaging-extensions-ms-teams/01.png)

5. Click **Create**.
6. Fill in the details to create Bot channels registration.

    ![](/media/2020-08-28-action-messaging-extensions-ms-teams/02.png)

7. Click **Create**.
8. The new Bot channels registration is ready.

    ![](/media/2020-08-28-action-messaging-extensions-ms-teams/03.png)


**Get the App Id and secret**

1. From the left menu, click **Settings**.
2. Add **Messaging endpoint** as ngrok URL.

    ![](/media/2020-08-28-action-messaging-extensions-ms-teams/04.png)

3. Click **Microsoft App ID (Manage)**.
4. Under **Certificates &amp; secrets** , create **New client secret**.

    ![](/media/2020-08-28-action-messaging-extensions-ms-teams/05.png)

5. Note down the values for future reference.


**Configure MS Teams Channel**

1. From the left menu, click **Channels**.
2. Click **Configure Microsoft Teams Channel**.

    ![](/media/2020-08-28-action-messaging-extensions-ms-teams/06.png)

3. Follow the instructions to configure the MS Teams channel.


## Implement Action Messaging extension with Yo Teams

We will generate a solution using Yo Teams.

1. On the command prompt, type below command.

    ```
    yo teams
    ```

2. Follow the wizard to set up the solution.

    ![](/media/2020-08-28-action-messaging-extensions-ms-teams/07.png)

3. On the command prompt, type code . to open the solution in visual studio code.
4. In the .env file, configure application ID and client secret from Bot channels registration.

## Planets Data as Backend

We will implement Planets data as a backend to query against.

Add a new file ```planets.json``` to the "/src/app" folder and add the following JSON to it:

```json

  }
```


## Implement Action Messaging extension with Yo Teams

Update the action messaging extension to use Planet information.

1. Open file "src\app\planetActionMessagingMessageExtension\PlanetActionMessagingMessageExtension.ts".
2. Update ```onFetchTask``` method as below to show input message for planet selection:

    ```typescript
    public async onFetchTask(context: TurnContext, value: MessagingExtensionQuery): Promise<MessagingExtensionResult | TaskModuleContinueResponse> {
        return Promise.resolve<TaskModuleContinueResponse>({
            type: "continue",
            value: {
                title: "Input form",
                card: CardFactory.adaptiveCard({
                    $schema: "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
                    type: "AdaptiveCard",
                    version: "1.2",
                    body: [
                        {
                            type: "TextBlock",
                            text: "Please enter planet name to insert into the message:"
                        },
                        {
                            type: "Input.Text",
                            id: "planetName",
                            placeholder: "Enter planet name (e.g. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune)"
                        },
                    ],
                    actions: [
                        {
                            type: "Action.Submit",
                            title: "OK",
                            data: { id: "unique-id" }
                        }
                    ]
                })
            }
        });
    }
    ```

3. Update ```onSubmitAction``` method to query the planet data in json format and display the planet information.

    ```typescript
    public async onSubmitAction(context: TurnContext, value: TaskModuleRequest): Promise<MessagingExtensionResult> {
        // load planets & sort them by their order from the sun
        const planets: any = require("../planets.json");

        // get the selected planet
        const selectedPlanet: any = planets.filter((planet) => planet.name === value.data.planetName)[0];

        // load display card
        const adaptiveCardSource: any = require("../planetDisplayCard.json");

        // update planet fields in display card
        adaptiveCardSource.actions[0].url = selectedPlanet.wikiLink;
        find(adaptiveCardSource.body, { "id": "cardHeader" }).items[0].text = selectedPlanet.name;
        const cardBody: any = find(adaptiveCardSource.body, { "id": "cardBody" });
        find(cardBody.items, { "id": "planetSummary" }).text = selectedPlanet.summary;
        find(cardBody.items, { "id": "imageAttribution" }).text = "*Image attribution: " + selectedPlanet.imageAlt + "*";
        const cardDetails: any = find(cardBody.items, { "id": "planetDetails" });
        cardDetails.columns[0].items[0].url = selectedPlanet.imageLink;
        find(cardDetails.columns[1].items[0].facts, { "id": "orderFromSun" }).value = selectedPlanet.id;
        find(cardDetails.columns[1].items[0].facts, { "id": "planetNumSatellites" }).value = selectedPlanet.numSatellites;
        find(cardDetails.columns[1].items[0].facts, { "id": "solarOrbitYears" }).value = selectedPlanet.solarOrbitYears;
        find(cardDetails.columns[1].items[0].facts, { "id": "solarOrbitAvgDistanceKm" }).value = Number(selectedPlanet.solarOrbitAvgDistanceKm).toLocaleString();

        // return the adaptive card
        const card = CardFactory.adaptiveCard(adaptiveCardSource);

        return Promise.resolve({
            type: "result",
            attachmentLayout: "list",
            attachments: [card]
        } as MessagingExtensionResult);
    }
    ```


## Test the solution

Follow the below steps to test the action messaging extension.

1. On a separate command prompt, run below command.

    ```
    ngrok.exe http 3007
    ```

    ![](/media/2020-08-28-action-messaging-extensions-ms-teams/09.png)

2. Inside .env file, update HOSTNAME=35a70dfecd85.ngrok.io
3. In Azure Bot Channel registration, update Messaging endpoint.

    ![](/media/2020-08-28-action-messaging-extensions-ms-teams/10.png)

4. On the command prompt, type below command.

    ```
    gulp build
    gulp manifest
    ```

5. The .zip package will be available under the packages folder.
6. On the command prompt, type below command.

    ```
    gulp serve --debug
    ```

7. Open MS Teams.
8. Under **Apps**, click **Upload a custom app**.

    ![](/media/2020-08-28-action-messaging-extensions-ms-teams/11.png)

9. Click **Add**.
